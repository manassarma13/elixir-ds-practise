# Elixir Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## Introduction

This repository contains my practice implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms using Elixir. Each file in this project corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm, with code that is designed to be clear and educational. The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of both Elixir and key computer science concepts.

## Topics Covered

1. **Arrays and Strings**
   - **Description**: Basic operations on arrays (represented as lists) and strings in Elixir, including indexing, concatenation, and length calculation.

2. **Hashing**
   - **Description**: Implementation of basic hashing operations using maps in Elixir, including computing and storing hash values.

3. **Linked Lists**
   - **Description**: Operations on linked lists, demonstrating how Elixir's list data structure inherently behaves as a linked list.

4. **Stacks and Queues**
   - **Description**: Implementation of stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) operations using Elixir lists and the `:queue` module.

5. **Trees and Graphs**
   - **Description**: Basic binary tree operations and graph traversal (BFS) using Elixir tuples and maps, representing tree nodes and graph adjacency lists.

6. **Heaps**
   - **Description**: Simulating a heap structure using the `:gb_trees` module in Elixir, which is used to efficiently retrieve the smallest element.

7. **Greedy Algorithms**
   - **Description**: An example of a greedy algorithm, the Activity Selection Problem, which demonstrates making locally optimal choices to achieve a global solution.

8. **Binary Search**
   - **Description**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm on a sorted list, demonstrating efficient search for a target element.

9. **Backtracking**
   - **Description**: The N-Queens problem as an example of a backtracking algorithm, where possible solutions are explored recursively, and invalid paths are abandoned.

10. **Dynamic Programming**
    - **Description**: The Fibonacci sequence implemented using dynamic programming, illustrating how to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.

## Running the Code

To run any of these programs, ensure you have Elixir installed on your machine. Navigate to the project directory and run a specific file using the `elixir` command:
